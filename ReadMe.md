# Epyphite SPACE Integrations

This repository holds public integrations of open API from different space agency, both as libraries and binaries independent tools
It's an effort to povide GOLANG SDK and include into the ResilientOne engine.

## NASA

The NASA open API offers a variety of open data protocols, the majority in JSON format.
Our goal is to be able to offer a Golang library to access those and integrate them with our application Eco System.

## Launch API

Launch API goal is to provide a REST and GRPC interface to our Launch Mass design and payload mass configuration systems.
It will also hold in future efforts a Web Inteface to manipulate and plot data.
