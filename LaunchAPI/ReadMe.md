# Launch API

Epyphite's Launch model API it's the initial step to space transparency and distributed computing for our company.
Launch API goal is to provide a REST and GRPC interface to our Launch Mass design and payload mass configuration systems.
It will also hold in future efforts a Web Inteface to manipulate and plot data.

## API

Launch API is built in GO Lang and joins Epyphite's effort to use ResilientOne as the main precursors for distributed and safe intelligence.
For that reason LaunchAPI is connected to our distributed backend that will caculate usage, permissions, telemetry and security.
