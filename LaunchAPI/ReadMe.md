# Launch API

Epyphite's Launch model API it's the initial step to space transparency and distributed computing for our company.

We expect to be able to calculate mass payload claims, and rocket design methodologies, and create a first integration tool for other startups to use as a base rool, make decisions and finally integrate in their designs.

## API

Launch API is built in GO Lang and joins Epyphite's effort to use ResilientOne as the main precursors for distributed and safe intelligence.
For that reason LaunchAPI is connected to our distributed backend that will caculate usage, permissions, telemetry and security.

Launch API can be accessed by REST at

```bash
curl https:://epyphite.com/resilientOne/space/launchapi/v1
```
